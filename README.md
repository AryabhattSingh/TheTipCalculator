## Technologies Used

This project demonstrates the use of several concepts and technologies:

- **Python:** The project is written in Python, a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language.
- **ASCII Art:** The program displays ASCII art at the beginning, adding a visual touch to the user experience.
- **Input Handling:** Python's `input()` function is used to gather user input, making the program interactive.
- **Type Casting:** The `float()` and `int()` functions are employed to convert input strings to appropriate numeric data types.
- **String Formatting:** The program utilizes `f-strings` to embed expressions and calculated values in string literals.
- **User-friendly Messages:** `Multi-line strings` are used to display clear and informative messages to the user.
